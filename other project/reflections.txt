You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!
- I have learned progamming skills with HTML language like paragraph, image, link. Also, I have learned how to use Udacity Feedback in Google Chrome to help me with coding and get along with Atom to program.
- Easy parts are HTML elements which are quite literal.
- Difficult are layout of a website and mockup which is the new thing to me.
- I looked at the pdf file of the mockup and noted down the changes I needed to make with my code. For example, in first/second/... paragraph what I needed to add. If anything related to HTML elements that I hadn't learned, I would use Mozilla Developer Network's HTML reference. Then I would complete each part then I refreshed the page to see the changes. If it was relevant to the mockup, I would move on the next paragraph.
